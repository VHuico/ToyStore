This project is about a Toy Store. It has objects representing the toys with its characteristics(attributes), an inventory counting 
how many toys you have, and a Shopping Cart, where you can add toys to buy.

It has different methods to add or remove toys from the inventory, to edit the toys, to display the toy's information, etc.

It utilizes all basic aspects of programming in Java: different types of variables, arrays, methods and objects.
